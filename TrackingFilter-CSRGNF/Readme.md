The above matlab script contains the Matlab Class.

The formulas and steps are extracted from the following papers

1. Doppler only tracking By Francois Maarsdorp
2. Target Tracking in the recommnder space by Stephen Middleton supervised by Mike Inggs
3. Recursive Gauss Newton filter from Roaldje Nadjiasngar and Mike Inggs
4. Gauss Newton and Polynomial Filters by Dr Norman Morrison

The Matlab implementation of the Covariance Scaling Unscented Kalman Filter for tracking in 
the Bistatic Range and  Doppler Domain follows a similar approach to the Kalman filter's convariance scaling method.
