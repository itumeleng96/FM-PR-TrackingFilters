# Tracking Filters For a Passive Radar System

### This Repository will consist Code implementations for Tracking Filters for a FM Passive Radar System.<br>

#### The Repository is divided into code processing chain for Simulations and all the required files and Real world data folder for the Radar Processing Chain For real-data

#### The Following Tracking filters and code have been implemented:
<li>1.Kalman Filter and Adaptive Kalman Filter</li>
<li>2.Particle Filter  and Adaptive Particle Filter</li>
<li>3.Unscented Kalman and Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter </li>
<li>4.Recursive Gauss Newton Filter and Adaptive Recursive Gauss Newton Filter</li>
<li>5.Covariance Scaling Techniques</li>

#### Other algorithms implemented
<li>Constant False Alarm Rate Filter </li>
<li>Multi-target Tracker</li>
<li>MeanshiftCluster</li>
<li>Log-likelihood as a statistical Benchmark for the Performance of Tracking Filters </li>
<li>Ground truth calculations for FERS for cubic waypoints</li>


## How to run the tracking Filter in the Matlab Terminal
<li> runTrackingFilterPlot </li>

## Filter Evaluations with Log-Likelihood
